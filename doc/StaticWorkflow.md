# Preferences Edge Proxy Refinement I

This describes the requests, responses, and payloads for the workflow where a
static site makes save/retrieve requests of a secured preferences server.  For
example, the static site may have incorporated UIO+ into their pages.  The user
wants to save or retrieve their UIO+ preferences.

The outline of the workflow is taken verbatim from the Fluid wiki page titled
"GPII Preferences Edge Proxy Refinement I", specifically, the [Workflow](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/GPII+Preferences+Edge+Proxy+Refinement+I#GPIIPreferencesEdgeProxyRefinementI-Workflow)
section.

The example requests and payloads assume that the OAuth2 authorization server
is Google.  Google provides an [OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/)
where each step can be tried and information about the requests is
displayed.  The playground requires a Google developer account.  For the
"Select and authorize APIs" step in the playground, select the "Google OAuth2
API v2" API set.

## Draft WORKFLOW for end user interacting with the combined system

1. User is on the site belonging to the preferences consumer. Embedded on it is
   a prefs editor which they have interacted with. They select an action which
   requires interaction with the prefs server (in the wireframes, Import or
   Export) Step 0
2. We enter Step 1 of the OAuth flow - the user’s browser is redirected to
   GET <authorization-server>/authorize - Step 1a - they see a LOGIN UI
   (implemented by the GPII authorization server)
  - a. This endpoint is NOT exposed at the same origin as the preferences consumer
     to avoid leakage of these credentials
  - b. In the current authorization server endpoint this is exposed at the URL
     /login
  - c. The authorization server’s endpoint /login will need to be exposed by the
     overall cluster’s proxy configuration at a distinct origin

```
In the following, the REQUIRED, OPTIONAL, and RECOMMENDED are as documented in
the [OAuth2 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.1)

Line feeds in the URLs are for clarity and to avoid long lines that scroll
horizontally.

GET https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
    ?client_id=:clientId&redirect_uri=:redirectUri&scope=:scope
    &response_type=code&state-:state&access_type=offline
Payload: none

"Google, authorize a user to access the preferences server."

Parameter breakdown:
- client_id
  - REQUIRED
  - Generated by Google during a prior manual registration process.
  - Stored by the client in its database.
  - Passed to Google by the client when making this /o/oauth2/auth/ request
  - This is the client_id associated with the preferences server.
  - Stored in the proxy server's database?
- redirect_uri
  - RECOMMENDED
  - Decided on by the client and set during the manual Google registration
    process.  It is stored in Google's database.
  - Used by Google at the end of its authorization process to call back to the
    client.  Thus it must be an endpoint implemented by the client.
  - Can also be used as another way to confirm that the client *is* legitimate
    since it is known to both parties and can be checked.
  - But, passing a redirect_uri that Google does not have registered is allowed,
    and is a way to have multiple callbacks.
    - It may be that even if the endpoint is different, the callback's host
      domain must be identical to one registered with Google -- this
      requires further invesitigation. For example, the redirect registered with
      Google might be "preferences.org/callback/", but on this request, it's set
      to "preferences.org/anothercallback/".  Same server, different end point.
  - If no redirect_uri is specified, Google will use the one in its database
    that was set at manual registration.
- scope
  - OPTIONAL
  - defines which information about the user is shared by this authorization
  - the format of this parameter is defined by Google, e.g. "profile" for user's
    name and email; "openId" to get an OpenID JWT.  Other OAuth2 providers may
    define their scopes differently.
- response_type
  - REQUIRED
  - one of [code, token, or an extended type], depending on the workflow.
  - "code" means this is a request for an authorization code, and, ultimately,
    an access token.  The rest of this document assumes "code", but the "token"
    work flow might be more appropriate for the proxy server scenario -- this
    needs further investigation.
  - "token" is used in the "Implicate Grant" workflow
    (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.2).  Here, the resource owner
    (who is that?) asks the authorization server (Google) to first check the
    client_id and redirect_uri against its known clients (the preferences
    server is the client).  If they match, Google will somehow authenticate the
    resource owner.  If successful, Google will respond with an access token,
    sending it to the client -- skip to step 5.
  - an extended type is a mutually defined type known to the client and provider
    See "Defining New Types" in the OAuth2 spec: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#se
- state
  - RECOMMENDED
  - generated by the client and passed back-and-forth between the client and
    Google for the duration of the OAuth2 process.  Another way both parties
    can confirm that the exchange is legitimate.
  - needs to be stored somewhere by the client for use throughout the
    authorization process (see final step 5 below -- the client stores it inside
    the same record as the one containing the access token).
- access_type
  - OPTIONAL and specific to Google's implementation of this endpoint.
  - One of [online, offline]
  - "Offline" means to return a refresh token in addition to an access token at
    the point in the process where Google sends the access token (Step 5 below),
    and whenever reauthentication requests are made of Google.
  - "Online" means to not issue a refresh token.
  - Google must store the access_type value.
  - Client will store this vaue in its database when it receives the access
    token (Step 5 below)
```

3. The login UI redirects the user back to the consumer’s space, now including
   an AUTHORIZATION CODE in the URL - Step 2. This can be read from the
   consumer’s origin by client or server-side code.

```
Specification reference for this step: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.2

GET https://<callback_uri>/
    ?state=:state&code=:code
    &scope=email profile openid https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile
    &authuser=0&prompt=consent
Payload: none
"Preferences Server, I (Google) have authorized this user; here's an
authorization code".

- callback_uri
  - The callback_uri either passed at the previous step, or the callback_uri
    stored by Google in its database when the client was registerd with Google.
  - Used as the client's endpoint for Google to inform the client that the user
    was successfully authorized.
- code
  - REQUIRED
  - The authorization code (random characters) generated by the authorization
    server (Google).
- state
  - REQUIRED IF SENT BY CLIENT AT PREVIOUS STEP
  - The same value that the client generated and sent to Google at the previous
    step and used to check the legitimacy of this request.
  - If no state was generated at the previous step, Google does not send a
    state value on this callback request.
- scope
  - NOT PART OF THE OAUTH2 SPEC
  - Sent by Google using their format specifying the scope of the access to
    information about the user stored on Google's site.  For example:
    - email
    - profile
    - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email
    - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile
- authuser=0
  - NOT PART OF THE OAUTH2 SPEC
  - Sent by Google indicating ??? -- not sure what this is.
- prompt=consent
  - NOT PART OF THE OAUTH2 SPEC
  - Sent by Google indicating ??? -- guess -- that consent was asked of the user
    and they agreed.
```

Comment:  the above is how OAuth2 normally works.  The requirement for the Edge
Proxy is for the redirection, the `redirect_uri`, to return to the consumer's
space, passing it the authorization code -- "Consumer
(static-site-with-prefs-editor), I (Google) have authorized this user; here is
an authorization code".  Can this be done?

4. Step 3 - this is then separately provided to the /access_token endpoint to
   exchange for an access token which can be used in further requests for
   preferences.
  - a. The /access_token endpoint *is* proxied by the edge server.
  - b. Part of this POST body is the client secret. It appears that providing this
     is the key responsibility of the multi-personality server. It will be
     maintained securely in its configuration and fished out when it receives a
     matching request from the edge server.

```
OAuth2: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.3

POST https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token
Body:
 grant_type=authorization_code
 code=:the_authorization_code
 redirect_uri=:redirect_uri
 client_id=:client_id
 client_secret=:client_secret

"Okay Google, please give me (Preferences Server) an access token. Here's the
authorization code you sent me (as well as the original callback uri, my id, and
the secret we share)."

- grant_type
  - REQUIRED
  - must be set to "authorization_code"
- code
  - REQUIRED
  - The authorization code sent by Google at the previous step where it called
    back to the client.
  - Google checks this value against the one it sent at the previous step.  They
    must be identical.
- redirect_uri
  - REQUIRED
  - The redirect_uri that was specified in the first step by the client.  This
    must be identical.
- client_id
  - REQUIRED if the client was not authenticated previously.
  - the client_id generated by Google during manual registration with Google.
  - as noted at step 1, the client_id is stored in the client's database.
- client_secret
  - REQUIRED if the client was not authenticated previously.
  - the client_secret that was generated by Google during manual registration.
  - the client_secret is stored in the client's database.

Note that GPII stored the client_id and client_secret as part of the
"Client Credentials" record.  The django-allauth package stores them in a
"Social Application" record.
```

5. The access token can be used in preferences endpoints.
  - a. Question - is identication purely by access token sufficient for all of
     these endpoints? it appears that the authorization server can always decode
     the preferences consumer’s id by fishing this out of its tables indexed by
     the token - does this mean that the edge server’s actions for all these
     endpoints can just be a no-op proxying?
  - b. Question - i) do we still need two different grant types (authorization
     code, and client credentials) - ii) does the presence of these different
     grant types have any implications at all for the implementation of the edge
     and proxy servers?

```
OAuth2: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.4

"Preferences Server, here is your access token."

Response from Google:
Payload example:
{
   "access_token": "2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
   "token_type": "Bearer",
   "expires_in": 3600,
   "refresh_token": "tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA",
}

- access_token
  - REQUIRED
  - The access token issued by Google
- token_type
  - One of [bearer, mac], and used in the Authorization block of future request
    headers.  GPII and Clusive use "bearer".
  - e.g., Authorization: Bearer 2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA
  - see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-7.1 for more details.
- expires_in
  - RECOMMENDED
  - The number of seconds, typcially 3600, that the access_token is vald for.
- refresh_token
  - OPTIONAL
  - Can be used by the client to request a new access_token from Google when the
    current one expires.
  - Client must use the same authorization_code as in the previous step to get
    a new access_token.
- scope
  - OPTIONAL if identical to the scope specified in the first step.
  - REQUIRED if no scope was initially specified by the client at step one.
  - Defines the scope of access to Google user's information, e.g., their gmail
    address.  The format is specified by the authorization server (Google).
- state
  - REQUIRED if there was a state given in the authorization request at step
    one.
  - It must match the state generated by the client at step one.

All of the above is stored in a record in the client's data base. GPII
termed them "App Installation Authorization" records.  The django-allauth
library calls them "Social Application Token" records.
